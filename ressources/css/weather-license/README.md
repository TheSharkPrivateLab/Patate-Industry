### Usage
1) Add the following line to your HTML `<head>` tag:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/moqmar/weather.css/master/weather.min.css">
```
2) Now you can use any container with `class="weather rain"` or `class="weather snow"` and it will snow or rain inside it! ;)
